                <h1>Job Materials</h1>
                <p>If you're on the job market or helping to run a job workshop, please feel free to use my materials! I am happy to answer questions or speak with you if you're on the job market. It is a traumatic and exhausting time; I applied for 80+ jobs, so I understand that exhaustion. My materials are not perfect, but they did help me get a job during the first year of COVID.</p>

                  <p><strong>Materials context</strong>: These were specifically created for an Assistant Professor in English, with a focus on Professional Writing, at Jacksonville State University, a teaching-centered school. I did not send in all these materials, as they were not all required, but I will include them here.</p>
