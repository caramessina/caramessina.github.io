                <h2>Job Market Template Folder</h2>
                <p>So you're on the job market. Eep! I have created this template folder, "<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iY9BESqP8xWwthE6HLGN0d1mAkxcnkcX?usp=drive_link">20XX-20XX-JobMarketTemplate</a>" folder that you can use for your own job market process or if you are teaching a job market workshop (please just cite me).</p>
                <p>If you would like to use this template folder, please download it or copy it into your own Google Drive folder. Here are the materials in the folder:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>README: an instrucitonal document that breaks down the folder, recommends a workflow, and shows some samples of the template in use.</li>
                  <li>Template-JobSpreadsheet: A template spreadsheet with recommended columns and dropdown menus to make the process of keeping track of a ton of jobs easier.</li>
                  <li>00-TemplateJobDocuments: A template folder that has the documents you may need. I recommend updating the documents with your own documents (or, if you are starting from scratch, building upon some of the recommendations in each document). I also included my sample documents in a folder, which you can also find below.</li>
                  <li>01-Interviews: A folder where you would put information about your interviews, including how you plan to answer particular questions or documents you may need for campus visits.</li>
                  <li>2024-09-01-UniTitle: A sample folder for an individual job. This is mainly to show my recommended naming convention for individual job folders. I highly recommend an individual job folder for each job you apply for.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Sample Materials</h2>
                <p>If you're on the job market or helping to run a job workshop, please feel free to use my materials! I am happy to answer questions or speak with you if you're on the job market. It is a traumatic and exhausting time; my first year, I applied for 80+ jobs. My materials are not perfect, but they did help me get a job during the first year of COVID. I also added my cover letter from Marist College.</p>
