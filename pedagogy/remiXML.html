            <h2>Process and Justification</h2>


<h2>Version 1</h2>
            <p>The first version, which I used in my Fall 2017 semester First Year Writing course,
                had more generalized elements that did not encourage specific categories. There was
                also an element, called feedback, which encouraged peer revision techniques. Student
                writers in the classroom used the remiXML version 1 to mark up published texts by
                authors like Roxane Gay, Claudia Rankine, and Shirley Jackson. They also used the
                remiXML to mark up each others’ essays as an attempt to bridge the gap between
                “professional” writer and themselves. The version was successful in encouraging peer
                review, but most student writers used the and tag on each others’ work. The focus
                became more on “review” than “engagement.” To find more documentation about remiXML
                version 1.0, <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML/tree/master/version1">please visit the version1 folder on my GitHub page</a>.  </p>
              <p>One of the challenges with using the remiXML schema for peer review feedback were the conflicts between the original intention of the schema design and how the students wanted to use it for feedback. Half-way through the semester, students asked for the includion of a "feedback" element. Then, for peer review, students mainly alternated between the "question" and "feedback" element. I also used the remiXML schema to provide feedback and found I, too, was mainly relying on those two elements. The issue here was how the design intention did not mirror the genre of peer review. Peer review relies on audience perspective, while fanfiction genres rely on transformative elements. Both these genres are about <em>audience</em>, but the audience roles differ.</p>
                <p>Here are some samples of student work from the first version:</p>

                </ul>

<h2>Version 2</h2>
            <p>Based off this experience, remiXML version 2.0 focused more on creative approaches to
                reading and attempting to categorize types of reading more explicitly. For example,
                the element became and several attributes values were added. Several elements were
                in the original version (restory was called transform, however); with the extra
                attributes, though, I have hoped to inspire student writers to use these attributes
                in more specific and pointed ways (the new attributes were borrowed from Ebony
                Elizabeth Thomas and Amy Stornaiuolo's article "Restorying the Self"). For example, the element has an attribute value called “bending,” which asks the student user to bend the identity of a particular character. This is inspired by racebending, queerbending, genderbending, and other types of identity bending practices that fanfiction writers take on in their work. </p>
    <p>
      The feedback element was also erased in the second version, as I decided to assign the remiXML
      for student writers to mark up professional authors’ texts instead of both professional
      authors’ and their peers’ work. I began referring to “peer review” as “peer engagement,” as
      well, to encourage a focus on reading as active and excited readers, rather than reading to
      review. For more documentation about remiXML version 2.0, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML/tree/master/version2">version2 folder on my GitHub page</a>.</p>
