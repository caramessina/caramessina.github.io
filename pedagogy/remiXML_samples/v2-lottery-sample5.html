      <p>The children <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">assembled<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>Why were the kids assembling in the summer, and where were they meeting?
                  It seems as though something important is going to happen and the kids had to convene.</span></span></span> first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the
         feeling of liberty sat <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RP1&#39;)">uneasily<span class="popuptext" id="RP1"><br><b>Replace: </b>Once school gets out for the summer, kids are almost always going to be
                  overjoyed or excited, so why were the kids sitting uneasily?</span></span></span> on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly
         for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the
         classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed
         his
         pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the
         smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the
         villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones
         in
         one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls
         stood aside, talking among themselves, <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR1&#39;)"> looking over their shoulders<span class="popuptext" id="CR1"><br><b>Close Read: </b>This must be a very old-school type of story, since the boys are actually
                  doing something while the girls are just idly watching.</span></span></span> at rolled in the
         dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters. </p>

      <p>Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and
         rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the
         corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women,
         wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted
         one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon
         the
         women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children
         came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under
         his
         mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke
         up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest
         brother. </p>

      <p>The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween
         program--by Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He
         was a
         round-faced, jovial man and he ran the <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;E1&#39;)">coal business<span class="popuptext" id="E1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>The coal business was a very profitable one back in the day, though it required
                  a long day of work. If Mr. Summers ran the coal business in that area, was he rich?</span></span></span> , and people were sorry for him.
         because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square,
         carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers,
         and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves,
         followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center
         of the
         square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR2&#39;)">The villagers kept their distance<span class="popuptext" id="CR2"><br><b>Close Read: </b>Given the title of this being "The Lottery" and the way Jackson describes
                  people's behavior in this, this situation is very reminiscent of the Hunger Games.</span></span></span> ,
         leaving a space between themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some
         of
         you fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin
         and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while
         Mr.
         Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

      <p>The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box
         now
         resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest
         man in
         town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box,
         but no one liked to upset even as much <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q2&#39;)">tradition as was represented by the black box<span class="popuptext" id="Q2"><br><b>Question: </b>What did the box or its papers do? What is the significance of the black box?!</span></span></span> .
         There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that
         had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down
         to
         make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again
         about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's
         being done. The <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RS1&#39;)">black box grew shabbier each year<span class="popuptext" id="RS1"><br><b>Restory: </b>[from the perspective of the black box] Another year has gone by, and
                  here I am. I am broken and exhausted, longing to be fixed. The only one who remotely
                  cares for me is Mr. Summers, who suggests to fix me up year after year. I cannot
                  continue on like this; I cannot stay broken forever. FIX ME!</span></span></span> : by now it was no longer completely
         black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in
         some
         places faded or stained.</p>
