                  the phrase "your offered to sit on" and leave that sentence as "From your arrival
                  orange juice to the comfy couch, the professionalism absorbed you instantly." Maybe
                  this is an opportunity to expand this sentence into a list for effect. i.e. "From

                  the perfect white carpet, the professionalism absorbed you instantly." Not sure this
                  is better, but a train of thought to consider.</span></span></span> </p>

      <p> “Mr. Hardie” Scarlett whispers at me through a perfect smile as she bends towards
         me, “ Dr. Moukeiber is ready for you.”
         “This way please.”

         She struts down an ever darkening passage way with her <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF8&#39;)">heals<span class="popuptext" id="BF8"><br><b>Replace: </b>heels</span></span></span> cracking the tiles at a perfect crotchet beat. With a quick pocket check I am off
         with no need for a second invitation.
         The winding five-minute walk gives me plenty of time to guess what will be analyzed
         in Mr. Moukeiber’s interview style. <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF9&#39;)">Lets see if the fat cat is rightfully feared.<span class="popuptext" id="BF9"><br><b>Question: </b>Why is it righfull that he should be feared? Does he hold some power over people or
                  command a presence?</span></span></span> </p>


      <p>The office was impressive. Again, clean and sharp just like the lobby. I was surprised;
         he was certainly small, but not fat. The iceberg of his bald head peaked over the
         back of his luxury chair-the hovering chair kept in the air by some new scientific
         discovery, a new CEO favorite. He was aware of our presence but as I expected his
         absentminded state looking at all the people walking fifty stories below was more
         interesting and didn’t require a fake smile or shallow conversation. The room was
         much hotter than the rest of the building, an obvious tactic to make me feel intimidated-his
         chair probably provided him with an invisible bubble of air-conditioning. With a sigh
         he spun around and looked at us. More her than me before she spun round and left.
         Leaving me in the wake of her Chanel. </p>


      <p> Then in a blinking transition he turned his gaze to me. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF10&#39;)">After looking my fresh hair cut,<span class="popuptext" id="BF10"><br><b>Replace: </b>did you mean to have an "at" here?</span></span></span> my new suit and iconic tie he returned his gaze to my eyes. He stretched out his
         arm and unfolded his hand – still saying nothing. </p>


      <p>This was expected as too was my natural response: right hand into left blazer pocket,
         pull out the remote and while doing so sliding out the USB with my thumb from the
         bottom. I carefully place both objects in his palm.</p>


      <p> With the silence guiding our interaction he slips the USB into the side of the television
         and leans back <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF11&#39;)">in his control.<span class="popuptext" id="BF11"><br><b>Question: </b>What do you mean by "his control"?</span></span></span> I love and fear this process-how someone holds all of my memories in their hand,
         the power to delete and view any single second of my life thus far. At the mercy of
         reality. </p>


      <p> “Right, Mr. Hardie – let us see your genuine personality.”

         He scrolled to the file – Years

         Down to 5.

         <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF12&#39;)">With a deep inhalation,<span class="popuptext" id="BF12"><br><b>Replace: </b>"A deep inhalation" sounds awkward to me because "a deep breath" is such a common
                  cliché</span></span></span> he chose the block titled “Loud” by the app.

         He opened the memory of that Thursday night. </p>


      <p>The replay begins as my eyes peak out from behind my bed covers. Their absolute hate
         for one another had just boiled over. At this point, feeling protective I leaped off
         the bed leaving my book behind and neglecting the ladder I crashed onto the floor.
         I sprawled towards the door and saw <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF13&#39;)">the white ball rolling down the passage.<span class="popuptext" id="BF13"><br><b>Question: </b>What is the white ball? My guess is you either meant to say something like 'my white
                  ball' or I am missing some larger meaning. Its probably the second one. </span></span></span> It looked like they were two spiders that where put in a jar together – a battle
         to the death. Even though their screaming was loud and I remember it scared me at
         the time, everything felt like it was happening in slow motion, my happy future crumbling
         right before my eyes. <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF14&#39;)">The videos starts to blur as the tears welled. I remember starting to feel cold as
               the tears soaked my pajamas. I closed my eyes – the video goes black – and my scream
               is piercing, doing everything in my power to stop this horrific dream instantly.<span class="popuptext" id="BF14"><br><b>Analysis: </b>This is amazing. I am picturing a movie where the main character begins to see through
                  the eyes of their five year old self. Their eyes well up an the screen does as well,
                  they blink once to try and clear the tears, but it flashes the main timeline. They
                  close their eyes again and the scene ends, returning to reality.</span></span></span> </p>


      <p>The brawl had ended and I clearly remember the strong smell of iron, I stood numb
         looking at the splatter dripping down the white wall. They where both badly hurt and
         the mosquito net was the evidence. Stained with the bright red blotches the once beautiful
         net was a painful sight. Her nightgown was torn and her head was bleeding as she limped
         towards me. He on the other hand lay stunned on the floor next to the net. He was
         also bleeding from his face. He tried to stand but stumbled to the aid of a chair,
         as one would have expected if you could have smelt him. </p>


      <p>The silence continued as I sat down against the wall. She walked past me towards her
         room. I stared at him. He looked broken, scared and lost. I could sense that he knew
         he had failed us and that our lives would be altered forever. He smiled at me and
         I forced a small one back, I could taste my salty tears. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF15&#39;)">She came back and three a small hide suitcase<span class="popuptext" id="BF15"><br><b>Replace: </b>threw not three</span></span></span> towards his and said,
         “Leave.”
         <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF16&#39;)">I whispered my question if he would be gone for long and she smiled again but did
               not answer.<span class="popuptext" id="BF16"><br><b>Analysis: </b>Another opportunity, like in your last piece, to use less words and convey the same
                  message. I think "...whispered my question if he would be gone for long..." is repetitive.
                  You could, for example, say "I whispered 'will he be gone for long?' but she merely
                  smiled again and did not answer."</span></span></span> It was a moment when I thought of all our happy moments – swimming, laughing and
         loving. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;BF17&#39;)">He walked towards the door, opened it and slid out. He never looked back.<span class="popuptext" id="BF17"><br><b>Replace: </b>He walked towards the door and slid out, never looking back.</span></span></span> The sound of the door closing, a grinding of metal followed by a clip-in sound, the
         sound that resembles the last time I ever saw him.</p>


      <p> He paused the memory and rubbed his eyes under his glasses.

         He stood up and walked over to me – looking up he said, “Well Mr. Hardie, where to
         from here?”
