         <h1>1984: Chapter 7</h1>
         <h2>By George Orwell</h2>
      </div>


      <p>If there was hope, it MUST lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming
         disregarded masses, 85 percent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy
         the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within. Its enemies,
         if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another.
         Even if the legendary <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'RP1')">Brotherhood<span class="popuptext" id="RP1"><br><b>Replace: </b>Sisterhood</span></span></span> existed, as
         just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble
         in
         larger numbers than twos and threes. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'EX1')">Rebellion meant
               a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered
               word.<span class="popuptext" id="EX1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>Expand this part by explaining the small happenings that could result in
                  large punishments.</span></span></span> But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their
         own strength. would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake
         themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party
         to
         pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? And
         yet——! </p>

      <p>He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous
         shout
         of hundreds of voices women’s voices—had burst from a side-street a little way ahead.
         It
         was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud ‘Oh-o-o-o-oh!’ that
         went
         humming on like the reverberation of a bell. His heart had leapt. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'RP2')">It’s started! he had thought. A riot!<span class="popuptext" id="RP2"><br><b>Replace: </b>It must just be a group of women, in twos and threes, yelling for the
                  saucepans that are on sale at the market.</span></span></span>
         <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'RS1')">The proles are breaking loose at last!<span class="popuptext" id="RS1"><br><b>Restory: </b>I would have never believed the sight I saw with my own eyes. The
                  Sisterhood had broken loose, at last!</span></span></span> When he had
         reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round
         the
         stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed
         passengers on a sinking ship. <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'RS2')">But at this moment the general despair broke down into a
               multitude of individual quarrels.<span class="popuptext" id="RS2"><br><b>Restory: </b>But at this moment, the general despair grew into a large rebellion. The Sisterhood
                  had finally taken a stance together, they recognized their power and strength as a
                  whole.</span></span></span> <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'RS3')">It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling
               tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were
               always difficult to get. Now the supply had unexpectedly given out. The successful
               women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans
               while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of
               favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh
               outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got
               hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another’s hands. For
               a
               moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston watched them
               disgustedly.<span class="popuptext" id="RS3"><br><b>Restory: </b>Describe the rebellion and how the Sisterhood had been secretly planning this for
                  a while. Describe the whole back story about the Sisterhood being like a sorority.</span></span></span> And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in
         that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like
         that about anything that mattered?</p>

      <p><br>He wrote:
         <br>Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled
            they cannot become conscious.</p>
