         No, it's Lady Cheetah, the famous jewel thief! She was only pretending to be the Royal
         Fortune-teller!
         That is how she stole Prince Tusk's jewels.</p>

      <p>Now <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR1&#39;)">she's trying to steal Prince Tusk's giant ruby.<span class="popuptext" id="CR1"><br><b>Close Read: </b> after the more masculine and covered version stole all the jewels, when she is a

      <p>Suddenly, <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">Sneef<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>What if Sneef is trying to stay in the Kings good graces and not cut off himself from

      <p><span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR2&#39;)">"Oh no you don't!" says Lady Cheetah,<span class="popuptext" id="CR2"><br><b>Close Read: </b>Women are trickster theives, not even straightforward</span></span></span> running off.</p>

      <p>"Look down here! That's the truck where Lady Cheetah put the stolen jewels," Sneef
         says. "That gives me an idea."</p>

      <p>Next to the treasure-laden truck, <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RE1&#39;)">Sneef waits  for Lady Cheetah with all Prince Tusk's guards.<span class="popuptext" id="RE1"><br><b>Restory: </b>Sneef knows that Lady Cheetah needs these jewels to pay for the medicine for her sick

      <p>"Drat! That detective is such a nuisance!" says Lady Cheetah.</p>

      <p><span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR3&#39;)">She tosses another small bottle on the ground.<span class="popuptext" id="CR3"><br><b>Close Read: </b>She is still shown as a trickster and not straighforward. The other stories with male

      <p>Psshhh! A cloud of smoke rises from the bottle</p>

      <p><span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;EX2&#39;)">"Until we meet again, Detective Sneef!" she says, as she escapes.<span class="popuptext" id="EX2"><br><b>Expansion: </b>She knew as long as no one would hire her due to her gender, she would have to continue
