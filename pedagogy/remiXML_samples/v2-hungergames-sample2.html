                  like Prim, and that she gives her comfort. Rue means a lot to Katniss, and she won't
                  let Rue die on her own.</span></span></span> I say. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'EX2')">I move in closer to her, pulling her hand onto my lap. I gently brush the dark, thick

      <p>"Sing," she says, but I barely catch the word.</p>

      <p>Sing? I think. Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or not, there was once
         music in my house, too. Music I helped make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable
         voice â€“ <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'Q2')">but I haven't sung since he died.<span class="popuptext" id="Q2"><br><b>Question: </b>Does the thought of singing remind you of your dad? Did you enjoy singing?</span></span></span> Except when Prim is very sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby.</p>

      <p>Sing. <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'Q1')">My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from the smoke and fatigue.<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>Do you think Rue realized that you were extremely sad at that moment? Were you successful
                  at hiding your feelings at that exact moment or did Rue see the change in your face?</span></span></span> <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'EX1')">But if this is Prim's, I mean, Rue's last request, I have to at least try.<span class="popuptext" id="EX1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>Katniss has lost a person that is like a sister to her, and she wants Rue to go as
                  peaceful as possible. So, Katniss tries her best to satisfy Rue's last request.</span></span></span> The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies
         to sleep with. It's old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my
         music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising
         tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today.</p>
