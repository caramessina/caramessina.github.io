      <p>The Wakefield twins aren't real; they are the main characters of the Sweet Valley
         High
         series. I started reading the Sweet Valley High books when I was eight yeaor nine
         years
         old. I was cross-eyed and wore thick bifocals. Other than my younger brother, I was
         the
         only black kid in school, so <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q3&#39;)">I was going to be
               noticed even though I wanted very much to go unnoticed.<span class="popuptext" id="Q3"><br><b>Question: </b>How is it that you want to be unotised when further in the story you
                  explain how you want to be popular and loved by others.</span></span></span> I was shy and
         awkward and didn't know how ot fix myself. My hair was wild, stood on end, earning
         me
         the inexplicable nicknames Hair, Bear, and Mustache even though I had nether a beard
         nor
         a mustache. My classmates also called me Don King. I looked nothing like Don King.
         He's
         a man, for one. <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;A1&#39;)">I was told my parents "talked
               funny," which I later realized wa a reference to their thick Haitian accents, which
               I did not hear until they were pointed out to me, and then suddenly those accents
               were all I heard.<span class="popuptext" id="A1"><br><b>Analysis: </b>I realize that the children are just trying to make her feel bad by
                  making fun of her parents. And while it succeeds, The reason it does wasn't because
                  her
                  parents were insulted (it may hurt a little though). The reason she felt bad was because
                  she begins to notice the differences between her family and other Americans and she
                  then
                  feels further away from her goal of becoming just 'one of the guys'. Also if the accents
                  were all she heard everytime her parents spoke this must have hit her hard. She feels
                  the weight of segregation very close to home.</span></span></span>
         <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">I read books while I walked to school<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>Isn't this dangerous? What could have happened if you weren't paying

         I had the strangest laugh – somewhat halted and tentative – and a bit of a bucktooth
         situation. I regularly wore overalls by choice and didn't really know and <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q2&#39;)">curse words, <span class="popuptext" id="Q2"><br><b>Question: </b>how does knowing curse words make one popular? doesn't it only give

      <p>When I first started reading Sweet Valley High books, I wanted girls like the Wakefield
         twins to love me. I wanted the handsome boys who chased girls like those Wakefield
         twins
         to love me. I wanted the popular kids to pull me into their shelter of their golden
         embrace and make me popular too. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R1&#39;)">Popularity is
               contagious. Many movies from the 1980s bear this theory out. I had hope, is what I'm
               saying, though certainly that hope was fragile.<span class="popuptext" id="R1"><br><b>Replace: </b> And even-though they would never accept me, I still held hope wrapped
                  in my little hands. I'd hoped that things would get better, that Things would change.
                  And they did. However, it was not by some grand act I had accomplished that They
                  accepted me. In fact it was the opposite. One afternoon as I was walking home reading
                  how Jessica was about to sneak out of the house, I was stopped by the popular kids.
                  They
                  began their verbal abuse by casually mentioning how 'odd' my parents sounded everytime
                  they opened their mouths. My little brother was there at the time and stood up for
                  our
                  mother and father, which earned him a shove to the ground by one of the older kids.
                  It
                  was at that moment that I couldn't stand it anymore and attacked. I knew that If I
                  tried
                  using words it would only come back to hurt me, so instead I used my fist. I whaled
                  on
                  the girl that pushed my brother down and broke her nose. After leaving to go get it
                  fixed, some of the other students who were getting picked on cheered for me. That
                  is how
                  I met Racheal and Heather, my best friends. And while I didn't become popular that
                  day,
                  it was definetly that last day I felt alone or needed to go into my own little world.
                  I
                  just continued writing myself inside the story becasue I enjoyed it.</span></span></span>
