      <p>"Oh," says Rue with <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, 'RP1')">a sigh<span class="popuptext" id="RP1"><br><b>Replace: </b>a dark distrusting tone</span></span></span>. "I've never had a whole leg to myself before.</p>

                  few people she trusted and for some reason she chose me the same way I chose her.</span></span></span></p>

      <p>"Take whatever you want. Now that I've got a bow and arrows, I can get more. Plus

Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. "Oh, take it," I say, putting the
         drumstick in her hands. "It will only kep a few days anyway, and we've got the whole
         bird plus the rabbit." Once she's got hold of it, her appetite wins out and she takes
         a huge mouthful.</p>

      <p>"I'd have thought, in District Eleven, you'd have a bit more to eat than us. You know,

                  food as they were starving started to give me chills.</span></span></span> "Oh, no, we're not allowed to eat the crops."</p>
