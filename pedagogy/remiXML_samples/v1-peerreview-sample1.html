         <h1>The impact of perfectionism on anxiety and depression</h1>
         <h2>By [Student Name]</h2>
      </div>


      <p>
         <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;FD1&#39;)">In the Journal of Psychology and Cognition we can
               find many different articles on human behavior but the one that stood out the most
               to me was The Impact of Perfectionism on Anxiety and depression.<span class="popuptext" id="FD1"><br><b>Feedback: </b>I like your introduction paragraph,it's really smooth and fluent.You
                  connect the name of your journal article,content of the article and your understanding
                  to the article very well.</span></span></span> This article called
         out to me as I believe paying attention to detail is highly important. In other
         words, it is important to understand the reason things happen and how they start.
         The impulsive behavior of perfectionism can grow and can lead to greater mental
         disorders that make treatment essential. In this article we can see how psychology
         is both <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">a science and humanity<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: This is an interesting statement. What do you mean that psychology is both a science
                  and humanity (also it would be humanities)? Like it is a mixture of the two disciplines?
                  If you're talking about discipline, humanity should be humanities*. What does "science"
                  and "humanities" mean to psychology? I like this idea a lot and would like to see
                  you think through it a bit more in your writing.</span></span></span> and how mental health is just as important as
         <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R1&#39;)">psychical<span class="popuptext" id="R1"><br><b>Replace: </b>CM: physical?</span></span></span> health.
         </p>

      <p>
         <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;FD2&#39;)">The article itself is appealing to the eye as
               the contrast between the colors blue (used for the title and heading of the article)
               and white (used for the background of the text) makes it easy to concentrate on what
               you are reading.<span class="popuptext" id="FD2"><br><b>Feedback: </b>I really like your thoughts here as my jornal article also have
                  white and blue colors but I didn't realized that different colors may make us feel
                  easy
                  and clear to read.After I read your analysis I had the same feeling as you.</span></span></span> <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q2&#39;)">It is also an easy text to comprehend as the article is
               divided into ten sub sections each with a clear heading making it simple to find what
               you are looking for in every section or to comprehend what each sub section has to
               offer.<span class="popuptext" id="Q2"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: Good observation. Why do you think this article would be written and structured
                  in a way that makes finding what you need easy? What does that say about how the author
                  anticipates how their audience will read the audience? What kind of audience might
                  the author be anticipating? How does this structure show this?</span></span></span><span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;ANA1&#39;)"> At the beginning the article offers
               an abstract, which is highly useful as this way the reader can have a general
               overview of what the article is going to talk about. Following the abstract there
               is
               a keyword section where important words that are repeated throughout the article are
               mentioned which is helpful to see what is important and in the article and what is
               not. Also, these words should be researched before hand so that the reader could get
               a grasp on what to expect.<span class="popuptext" id="ANA1"><br><b>Analysis: </b>From this part I know that you understand the structures and their
                  functions clearly.</span></span></span> After this brief background information we
         finally get to the introduction, which explains a little bit about the background
         on
         perfectionism and how it can lead to other, more severe, mental disorders. Next,there
         is
         a subsection on what perfectionism means specifically. Next there is another subsection
         with the different types of perfectionism that are found. Then it goes on to explain
         how
         it can lead to depression and anxiety and towards the end of the article it talks
         about
         treatment. The article is easily understood, as it is very organized. The author begins
         with the background, explains what perfectionism is specifically, the types of
         perfectionism that can be found and how they can lead to anxiety and depression and
         then
         goes on to talk about the treatment. Not only is it written in a very orderly fashion
         it
         is divided in a way that makes everything easy to find. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F1&#39;)">The subsections are very clear
               mentioning what will be stated in each paragraph to come. The journal itself is very
               user friendly as it is easy to comprehend, has a legible font, uses easygoing language
               and the content is valid and re-enforced by many different resources.<span class="popuptext" id="F1"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: Again, these are all good observations and you do a solid job breaking down what
                  the content of the article is and what it looks like. I'd like to see you do a bit
                  more of an analysis, though, where you explain why the article has made these choices.
                  Why was it written in a way that is easy to comprehend? A lot of peer-reviewed articles
                  are not like that, so why does the author make the choice to make it accessible and
                  easy to read?</span></span></span> </p>

      <p> The researcher sets up the idea by talking about a problem. First the researcher
         introduces the background then the causes and how perfectionism can develop into
         something more serious like anxiety or even depression. <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;QU1&#39;)">It is typical for psychology articles to begin with a problem, as that
               is what their job is, helping other people fix themselves so they can have a better
               mental state.<span class="popuptext" id="QU1"><br><b>Question: </b>Maybe you can add examples here or explain more about this general
                  trend?</span></span></span> The argument made is carried thoughtfully as since the
         beginning the argument builds up to why intervention and treatment are necessary to
         stop
         perfectionism into becoming any severe mental disorder. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F2&#39;)">The treatment subsection of the
               text analyzes why help is necessary and needed when perfectionism arrives to the point
               of depression or anxiety.<span class="popuptext" id="F2"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: To reaffirm [StudentName]'s suggestion, I'd like to see you talk a bit more about
                  your analysis! While you don't need to provide examples from other journals, I'd like
                  for you to explain why this is a priority and how this article's set up falls into
                  that priority in more depth. In this section, you talk about the problem statement
                  and the treatment; why is the article set up this way? Why is the treatment information
                  provided? How is the treatment information provided? Was it totally successful? Did
                  the author talk about any limitations of the study? What kind of limitations did they
                  mention? </span></span></span> </p>

      <p> The article cites its research after every few sentences by putting hyperlinked numbers
         at the end of a block of information. These hyperlinked numbers can also be found
         in the
         reference section next to a link meaning that whenever you click on a number it takes
         you to the direct site of where the information was found. This is very useful as
         the
         reader of the article that can very easily can get more background information on
         a
         specific subject or on a specific part of the article. <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q3&#39;)">The way this is done talks a lot
               about psychology as a discipline as again, it makes the article very user friendly.
               The
               author did everything in a way that makes it easier for the reader to have more
               background research on the subject as well as easier to understand and interpret the
               article.<span class="popuptext" id="Q3"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: Good analysis! Can you think of other reasons why these numbers would be used
                  instead of the more traditional APA format that looks like this (Messina, 2017)? Think
                  about what that would look like instead of the hyperlinked numbers.</span></span></span> </p>

      <p> Psychology bases its evidence on case studies. These are important because they are
         often used in explanatory research and this is how data is prevailed in psychological
         research. <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;QU2&#39;)">In this article there is no number
               based data nor are there any specific case studies instead many different
               psychologists are mentioned next to their work in a way that explains past research
               made on the subject and what each psychologist has to say.<span class="popuptext" id="QU2"><br><b>Question: </b>I am confusing about this sentence.May be you can add some of your
                  opinions like which way do you prefer or is the way your journal article used better
                  than case study in other articles?</span></span></span> There are
         hyperlinked <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F3&#39;)">numbers next to most of the information concerning the different
               psychologists as there is more research the reader can do on their own which each
               individual psychologist<span class="popuptext" id="F3"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: I agree with [StudentName]. I'd like to see you expand on this paragraph a bit.
                  So this article does not use an quantitative analysis or data, but what is the evidence,
                  exactly? Is it a literature review of other researchers who have done this work and
                  attempts to synthesize the work? Ithink making this more clear by stating "the data
                  used in this article is this...." and "the reason this type of data is used is because...."</span></span></span>. </p>

      <p> The only in text citations that are found in the text are the hyperlinked numbers
         found
         that can lead to each individual link so further can be made by the reader of the
         article. This is highly convenient because if the reader is interested in any given
         part
         of the article more research can be done. This journal uses the APA style of citation,
         which is the American psychological association, <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F4&#39;)">This makes sense, as it is a
               psychological paper and this is the citation format psychologist have created for
               their
               discipline. <span class="popuptext" id="F4"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: So I understand that you're following the format of the assignment, but I suggest
                  making sure this is paired with the section where you're talking about the hyperlinks
                  previously. Right now, your ideas feel like they jump around a bit and this can be
                  easily changed by putting all the areas where you talk about similar content either
                  in the same paragraph or in consecutive paragraphs.</span></span></span></p>

      <p>
         <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;EX1&#39;)">The conclusion of the article is relatively small
               compared to all the other paragraphs.<span class="popuptext" id="EX1"><br><b>Expansion:</b>I guess maybe the authors thought their results were clear enough so
                  they did not need to spend too much time on their conclusion.</span></span></span> It comes right after the treatment
         subsection, which is interesting as the conclusion talks about how many perfectionists
         reject professional help as that would imply that they are “flawed.” The conclusion
         speaks about the idea that therapy could be helpful for both the person with the
         disorder and the people that surround them so that they are able to comprehend what
         is
         happening. It is also stated that therapy does not always help the patient and that
         is
         why long-term therapies have proven to be helpful. The conclusion ends on a happy
         note
         explaining why the research is important by saying that steps are being taken to help
         perfectionists live happier lives. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F5&#39;)">This conclusion leaves a closed panorama for other
               researchers to pick up their work as it just states their research and what they have
               done and leaves no doors open for anyone to add anything else. <span class="popuptext" id="F5"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: I'm not sure what you mean here. I recommend re-explaining this</span></span></span>Never the less it
         connects all the dots and finishes the article off strong. </p>

      <p> <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;A1&#39;)">The journal containing the article I chose to analyze is open access meaning that
               it is
               open to the public.<span class="popuptext" id="A1"><br><b>Analysis: </b>CM: This was a strong first draft! Your observations pair well with much of your analysis.
                  I also really like this conclusion and wonder if its status as an open access journal
                  explains why it is more accessible. Can you talk a bit more about why  you think this
                  journal would want to be accessible to the public? Also, I'd like to see your analysis
                  get deeper. You do a great job of breaking down the content and I recommend now focusing
                  on your analysis and reasoning for why the authors and editors made the choices they
                  made.</span></span></span> There is no need for people interested in reading the article to
         subscribe. This is interesting as it talks about psychology and its values. Psychology
         as both a humanity and a science’s primary value is for people to be aware of their
         mental health and how treatment is important for prevention. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RE1&#39;)">The values for all psychologists are simple and all they want is to
               share their knowledge so that people are well educated on their mental
               health.<span class="popuptext" id="RE1"><br><b>Replace: </b>The aims of all psychologists are simple and all they want is to help
                  people better understand themselves and take care of their mental health. </span></span></span>
