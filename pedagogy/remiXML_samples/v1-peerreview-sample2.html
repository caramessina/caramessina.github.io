      </div>


      <p>	Pedagogy <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R1&#39;)">in the field of art in design is a topic that is<span class="popuptext" id="R1"><br><b>Replace: </b>This part of the sentence is a little clunky. Because it is the opening sentence maybe
                  reword to make stronger</span></span></span> widely contested across various institutions. As it is such a diverse, creative field,
         each educator has his or her own unique way of teaching design to students, <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F3&#39;)">and there are undoubtedly benefits and downfalls to each individual method<span class="popuptext" id="F3"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: Woohoo! Researching pedagogical practices is super important! Okay, now that I've
                  said that, I'd like to see this introduction become a bit more developed and specific.
                  Introduce your article more clearly here and talk about how your article relates to
                  the discipline of graphic design as well as how it relates to pedagogy; what kind
                  of argument does it make and why is it important? You begin to to do this in your
                  next paragraph, but it will be more powerful in your introduction and get your reader
                  straight to the point.</span></span></span>.</p>

      <p><span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;E1&#39;)">The article<span class="popuptext" id="E1"><br><b>Expansion:</b>Provide a transition sentence that explains "the article and its connections to what
                  we just talked about before going further into the details of the journal. Maybe even
                  include the title of the journal. </span></span></span> is broken into a few distinct sections: the introduction, which establishes basic
         background information and context for the study of graphic design, and also provides
         a space for the author to state her argument; a section on theory, which speaks to
         the subject of psychology as it relates to the development of a “design eye”; a thematic
         review, which examines the pedagogic aspects of design; a methodology section, which
         references pre-established theories and establishes the author’s basic analytic approach
         to the pedagogy of graphic design; three sections about affect in graphic design education;
         and a conclusion, which summarizes the author’s viewpoints and experiences in graphic
         design pedagogy into a concise final argument. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F1&#39;)">However, there are some unique elements to the journal that probably would not be
               found in academic journals of other disciplines. <span class="popuptext" id="F1"><br><b>Feedback: </b>This is a really good transition that also clearly links to what Cara wants us to
                  do with analyzing and not just summarizing. </span></span></span>The author includes three sections of anecdotal information regarding her experiences
         in observing graphic <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;T1&#39;)">design take place <span class="popuptext" id="T1"><br><b>Transformation: </b>This probably doesn't go under the transform tag but this needs an insert like design
                  "that" take</span></span></span>in spaces such as <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R2&#39;)">physical<span class="popuptext" id="R2"><br><b>Replace: </b>I understand why you put this here but I don't think you need it.</span></span></span> hallways, blogs, and social media. <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q2&#39;)">Each anecdote is followed by a thorough analysis, which in turn builds her final argument.<span class="popuptext" id="Q2"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: I agree with [StudentName] that you begin to move into analysis here. I wonder,
                  though, why the researcher decided to use anecdotes? You're right that anecdotes are
                  not the norm across the disciplines, so why do you think they're used in this article?
                  What makes anecdotal data different from other types of data? Why is it used when
                  discussing pedagogical practices?</span></span></span></p>

      <p>The author’s main argument r<span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F7&#39;)">elates to the problem of finding a foolproof, effective way to teach graphic design
               to students.<span class="popuptext" id="F7"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: I might push against this statement a bit. While a lot of people who study and
                  write about pedagogical practices are attempting to find innovative and productive
                  teaching methods, it's impossible to find a "foolproof" methods because a) every single
                  class taught is different, b) every single institution is different, and c) there
                  are so many different types of learners that attempting to build a class that suits
                  all of them is impossible.</span></span></span> The <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q3&#39;)">journal<span class="popuptext" id="Q3"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: "the journal" as in the journal article or the journal as a whole? The journal
                  is similar to a magazine in that it has multiple articles within it, and the journal
                  article is the actual article itself.</span></span></span> closely examines the <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F4&#39;)">psychology<span class="popuptext" id="F4"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: Interesting that this paper in the design and arts discipline discusses psychology;
                  what does it mean to use an outside discipline to analyze the data?</span></span></span> behind graphic design, and furthermore how this psychology plays into the effectiveness
         of graphic design pedagogy. <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q4&#39;)">The necessity of the author’s input lies not in the realm of immediate, crucial scientific
               research aimed at a specific question, but instead in the importance of a group of
               educators who are constantly trying to maximize the effectiveness of their teaching
               methods.<span class="popuptext" id="Q4"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: How does the researcher collect evidence and data? How do you know this is not
                  "scientific research?" What kind of research is it, then? Can you try to define it
                  or figure out how the author defines it?</span></span></span> In the academic community of art and design, there is less of an emphasis placed
         upon state-of-the-art research and more of an emphasis placed upon digging deeper,
         uncovering more knowledge, and posing theories regarding the design field. This is
         exactly what the author is trying to do:<span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)"> dig into human psychology<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>What are the psychological ideas behind the article? How do those effect the education
                  process?</span></span></span> as it relates to design, pose a theory and give evidence as to why her theory holds
         weight and should be taken into consideration. </p>

      <p>The journal cites various sources throughout the entirety of its content. Most of
         the sources closer to the beginning of the journal are related to psychology and its
         affect on graphic design; <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;T2&#39;)">more specifically, the ways in which design can invoke emotion in people, and how
               that emotion can be harnessed to, in turn, give people a better eye for design.<span class="popuptext" id="T2"><br><b>Transformation: </b>So this answers my Q1 but I think you could move it up to the other paragraph.</span></span></span> This establishes <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q5&#39;)">credibility<span class="popuptext" id="Q5"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: What does "credibility" mean in the design discipline? Credibility has different
                  definitions across the disciplines, so how does your discipline define "credibility?"</span></span></span> for the beginning of the author’s argument. Furthermore, much of the research the
         author incorporates is based in two major theories: the Actor-Network Theory, which
         deals with the relationship between “objects, people, and ideas”, and the Non-Representational
         Theories, which deal with the effects of our environments on how we express ourselves.
         The author states that she takes an “assemblage analytic approach” to the data, meaning
         that she will look closely at the connections between data and practices. Not only
         does the author incorporate several working theories into the journal, she also interweaves
         some of her own data, including observational and interactive data, collected over
         the years of her teaching graphic design online. All of the variety of sources that
         the author incorporates into her journal are widely dispersed. This is complementary
         to the piece because its argument is one that requires both a breadth and depth of
         data from multiple fields and viewpoints. The author is dispersing research throughout
         the journal in order to maintain a constantly strong foundation for her argument,
         as it is based both in psychology and <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F2&#39;)">design<span class="popuptext" id="F2"><br><b>Feedback: </b>This paragraph does a really nice job of analyzing a part of the article that could
                  be seen as un-analyze-able. </span></span></span>.</p>

      <p><span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R3&#39;)">Data, in this journal, is exclusively qualitative.<span class="popuptext" id="R3"><br><b>Replace: </b>The data in this journal is exclusively qualitative. (you don’t need to use the commas

                  made opposite suggestions on each other's work; she told you to use dashes and you
                  told her to use parenthesis. Hah!  </span></span></span> articles that speak to the feelings and emotions that can be invoked by good design,
         and the author’s own qualitative data from her years of professional experience in
         the field. What is unique about the article is that much of the data that is included
         does not immediately come across as actual data. Rather, it primarily comes across
         as other people's’ opinions, or simply anecdotes created by the author. <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F6&#39;)">However, just because there are no hard numbers or figures, the research and analysis
               is not inherently less valid or relevant. Simply, it is put together in a different
               manner that is more appropriate for the field of art and design. The audience of this
               article is primarily educators interested in what other professionals have to say
               about the pedagogy of graphic design; these educators would rather listen to the author
               recount her own real-life experiences and cite meaningful theories and sources than
               sort through a mess of numbers and figures.<span class="popuptext" id="F6"><br><b>Feedback: </b>CM: Yes! Absolutely! A thousand times yes! You're thinking about the audience, how
                  the "data" looks in this article, how the data is used, and why it is used that way.
                  Fantastic paragraph. Similar question to my credibility question, but how do you think
                  validity is measured in this type of article? Why do you think this article was published?
                  Obviously the editors found it to be useful and valid in some way, so how do you think
                  this was measured?</span></span></span> Therefore, the data makes sense in the context of the article. </p>

      <p>The citations are in <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q6&#39;)">APA format. <span class="popuptext" id="Q6"><br><b>Question: </b>CM: you mention that it's important to have current data for this type of work. Why
                  is that?</span></span></span>This is because it is important that the <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R7&#39;)">relevant data in the article is current and relevant<span class="popuptext" id="R7"><br><b>Replace: </b>you use "relevant" twice, maybe change one to "timely" or "pertinent" or "important"
                  </span></span></span>, especially the data relating to psychology. In-text citations are used throughout
         the journal, which makes sense as data is dispersed throughout the journal <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R6&#39;)">as well. <span class="popuptext" id="R6"><br><b>Replace: </b>I feel like i'm using these tags poorly, but maybe move this paragraph to early in
                  the paper around where you talk about previous sources? </span></span></span></p>

      <p>The conclusion brings all of the author’s previously established theories and analysis
         to a head. She effectively ties together the theories that she previously cited and
         the anecdotes the she herself wove into the text. The argument that has been floating
         around the article for its entirety finally comes together: the most effective pedagogic
         graphic design spaces are those which promote peer and community interaction and engagement,
         so that the student or learner can form an eye for design in the presence of others.
         Cooperation and collaboration is highly encouraged. The conclusion is subtle, yet
         effective; the author almost leaves it open for creative interpretation. <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;A2&#39;)">The piece itself ends on a hopeful note<span class="popuptext" id="A2"><br><b>Analysis: </b>CM: Fantastic job! There are parts I'd like for you to work on. For example in the
                  second paragraph, I recommend breaking down not only what each section does, but the
                  reason the section is there and placed where it is. Otherwise, you balance your analysis
                  and examples from the article well. Also, I love that you chose a piece on pedagogy
                  :)</span></span></span>, as if the author has given her best advice for other educators to continue to effectively
         foster the design <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;A1&#39;)">community.<span class="popuptext" id="A1"><br><b>Analysis: </b>This whole piece does a really great job of not just summarizing but actively figuring
                  out why things are done the way they are in the article. I think you might be able
                  to relate the way it is written to graphic design /journals/ as a whole a bit more,
                  but you do connect it well to its implications in the discipline. </span></span></span> </p>
