         <h1>The Lottery</h1>
         <h2>By Shirley Jackson</h2>
      </div>


      <p>The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer,
         and the
         feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly
         for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the
         classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed
         his
         pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the
         smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the
         villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;EP1&#39;)">a great pile of stones<span class="popuptext" id="EP1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>Enough for all the people in the town.</span></span></span> in
         one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls
         stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the
         dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters. </p>

      <p>Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and
         rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the
         corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women,
         wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">came shortly after their menfolk<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>Why did the husbands and wives not come together, but separately?</span></span></span>. They greeted
         one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon
         the
         women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children
         came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under
         his
         mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke
         up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest
         brother. </p>

      <p><span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR2&#39;)">The lottery<span class="popuptext" id="CR2"><br><b>Close Read: </b>I find it ironic how a lottery usually results in a happy winner, but in this

         program--<span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR1&#39;)">by Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities<span class="popuptext" id="CR1"><br><b>Close Read: </b>Mr. Summers is either a man of great authority, since he had the ability to
                  conduct and organize events that include all members of the community, or has nothing
                  else to
                  do with his time.</span></span></span>. He was a
         round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him.
         because he had no children and <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RS1&#39;)">his wife was a scold<span class="popuptext" id="RS1"><br><b>Restory: </b>Mr. Summers would spend all his time locked up in his study, thinking up grandiose
                  plans
                  for his so called "civic activities". On the rare occasions he did come out, he would
                  completely disregard
                  Mrs. Summers's existance, treating her like she was never a part of his life; the
                  silent compassion that
                  was once there was long gone. The only way she knew to get his attention, was to nag.
                  It also helped her
                  deal with the stress of not being able to bear a child.</span></span></span>. When he arrived in the square,
         carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers,
         and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves,
         followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center
         of the
         square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance,
         leaving a space between themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some
         of
         you fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin
         and his oldest son, Baxter. <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RP1&#39;)">came<span class="popuptext" id="RP1"><br><b>Replace: </b>trudged</span></span></span> forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr.
         Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

      <p>The original <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RP2&#39;)">paraphernalia<span class="popuptext" id="RP2"><br><b>Replace: </b>apparatus</span></span></span> for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now
         resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest
         man in
         town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box,
         but <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q2&#39;)">no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box<span class="popuptext" id="Q2"><br><b>Question: </b>If people are afraid of violating the tradition, why is Mr. Summers so eager to create
                  a new
                  black box?</span></span></span>.
         There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that
         had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down
         to
         make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again
         about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's
         being done. The black box grew shabbier each year: by now it was no longer completely
         black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in
         some
         places faded or stained.</p>
