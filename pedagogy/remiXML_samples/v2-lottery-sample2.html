      <p>The children <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;cr1&#39;)">assembled<span class="popuptext" id="cr1"><br><b>Close Read: </b>this word adds a feeling of seriousness and somber feeling, it lets us know this is
                  not a
                  normal gathering of children, makes us want to read more</span></span></span> first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the
         feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly
         for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the
         classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed
         his
         pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the
         smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the
         villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--<span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;cr2&#39;)">eventually made a great pile of stones in
               one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys.<span class="popuptext" id="cr2"><br><b>Close Read: </b>the word choice here brings back the pattern from the beginning going back between
                  the serious
                  language and more normal childish language and actions</span></span></span> The girls
         stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the
         dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters. </p>

      <p>Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;re1&#39;)">speaking of planting and
               rain, tractors and taxes.<span class="popuptext" id="re1"><br><b>Restory: </b>texting about phone bills, traffic and global warming</span></span></span> They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the
         corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women,
         <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;re2&#39;)">wearing faded house dresses and sweaters,<span class="popuptext" id="re2"><br><b>Restory: </b> rocking faded high waisted mom jeans and rainbow tie die tank tops</span></span></span> came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted
         one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon
         the
         women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children
         came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under
         his
         mother's grasping hand and <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;q1&#39;)">ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones.<span class="popuptext" id="q1"><br><b>Question: </b>why are the children happy and childish again all of a sudden?</span></span></span> His father spoke
         up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest
         brother. </p>

      <p>The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween
         program--by <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;ex1&#39;)">Mr. Summers<span class="popuptext" id="ex1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>with his rose tinted wire rimmed glasses and vest to try to distract from his balding
                  head</span></span></span>. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a
         round-faced, <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;re3&#39;)">jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him.
               because he had no children and his wife was a scold.<span class="popuptext" id="re3"><br><b>Restory: </b>a consistently scowling man whose wife ran a coal buisness. Everyone felt sorry for
                  her because he
                  was grumpy and lazy.</span></span></span> When he arrived in the square,
         carrying the black <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;rep1&#39;)"> wooden <span class="popuptext" id="rep1"><br><b>Replace: </b>metal</span></span></span>box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers,
         and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;re4&#39;)">Mr. Graves,<span class="popuptext" id="re4"><br><b>Restory: </b>Ms. Cheer</span></span></span>
         followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center
         of the
         square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance,
         leaving a space between themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some
         of
         you fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;q2&#39;)">hesitation<span class="popuptext" id="q2"><br><b>Question: </b>why are they hesitating?</span></span></span> before two men. Mr. Martin
         and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while
         Mr.
         Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

      <p><span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;cr3&#39;)">The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box
               now
               resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest
               man in
               town, was born.<span class="popuptext" id="cr3"><br><b>Close Read: </b>good way of saying how old the box is without saying "it was super old"</span></span></span> Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box,
         but no one liked to upset even as much <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;cr4&#39;)">tradition<span class="popuptext" id="cr4"><br><b>Close Read: </b>shows the lack of questioning of traditions and how even when dangerous keep doing
                  them
                  and why it is not a valid reason to continue actions without questioning them</span></span></span> as was represented by the black box.
         There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that
         had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down
         to
         make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again
         about a new box, <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;ex2&#39;)">but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's
               being done. The black box grew shabbier each year: by now it was no longer completely
               black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in
               some
               places faded or stained<span class="popuptext" id="ex2"><br><b>Expansion: </b>The fading box showed the fading tradition.</span></span></span>.</p>
