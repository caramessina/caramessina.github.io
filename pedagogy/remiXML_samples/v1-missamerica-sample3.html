      <p>The Wakefield twins <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;R1&#39;)">aren't real<span class="popuptext" id="R1"><br><b>Replace: </b>are fictional</span></span></span>; they are the main characters of the Sweet Valley High series. I started reading
         the Sweet Valley High books when I was eight or nine years old. <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;A1&#39;)"> I was cross-eyed and wore thick bifocals.<span class="popuptext" id="A1"><br><b>Analysis: </b>The juxtaposition here between her and the girls from Sweet Valley High is very apparent
                  and very effective. She pretty much paints herself as the exact opposite as those
                  girls, longing for everything they have and she doesn't. However, there are undertones
                  of her being proud of her background and of her individuality, since individuality
                  is something the girls from SVH don't have. </span></span></span> Other than my younger brother, I was the only black kid in school, so <span style="color:red"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">I was going to be noticed even though I wanted very much to go unnoticed.<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>She says here that she wants to go unnoticed, but most of her longings and dreams
                  involve her becoming popular. Isn't this a bit of a contradiction?</span></span></span> I was shy and awkward and didn't know how to fix myself. My hair was wild, stood
         on end, earning me the inexplicable nicknames Hair, Beard, and Mustache even though
         I had nether a beard nor a mustache. My classmates also called me Don King. I looked
         nothing like Don King. He's a man, for one. <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;T1&#39;)">I was told my parents "talked funny," which I later realized was a reference to their
               thick Haitian accents, which I did not hear until they were pointed out to me, and
               then suddenly those accents were all I heard.<span class="popuptext" id="T1"><br><b>Transformation: </b>One day, one of the girls from school mentioned that my parents "talked funny." This
                  left me in a whirlwind of confusing emotions. I had never had someone say that to
                  me before. I was confused- were they hearing something I wasn't? When I got home from
                  school that day and my mother greeted me at the door, I heard it. I went upstairs
                  to lay down. From that day on, it was all I ever heard.</span></span></span> I read books while I walked to school. I had the strangest laugh – somewhat halted
         and tentative – and a bit of a bucktooth situation. I regularly wore overalls by choice
         and didn't really know and curse words, so that should give you a sense of where I
         was on the social ladder – <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;F1&#39;)">reaching for the bottom rung.<span class="popuptext" id="F1"><br><b>Feedback: </b>This is a clever move as a writer to incorporate the visual of the "social ladder"
                  to give her readers an idea of just how much she was struggling.</span></span></span></p>

      <p>When I first started reading Sweet Valley High books, <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;E1&#39;)">I wanted girls like the Wakefield twins to love me. I wanted the handsome boys who
               chased girls like those Wakefield twins to love me. I wanted the popular kids to pull
               me into their shelter of their golden embrace and make me popular too.<span class="popuptext" id="E1"><br><b>Expansion:</b>I wanted girls like the Wakefield twins to love me. I wanted their long, sleek blond
                  hair and their shimmering green eyes. I wanted the handsome boys who chased girls
                  like those Wakefield twins to love me. I wanted them to long for me. I wanted them
                  to think I was more special than any girl they had ever met. I wanted the popular
                  kids to pull me into their shelter of their golden embrace and make me popular too.
                  It was all I wanted.</span></span></span> Popularity is contagious. Many movies from the 1980s bear this theory out. I had
         hope, is what I'm saying, though certainly that hope was fragile.</p>
