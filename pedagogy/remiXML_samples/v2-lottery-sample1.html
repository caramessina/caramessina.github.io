         <h1>The Lottery</h1>
         <h2>By Shirley Jackson</h2>
      </div>


      <p>The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer,
         and the
         feeling of <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR2&#39;)">liberty<span class="popuptext" id="CR2"><br><b>Close Read: </b>The author's choice to use the word "liberty" here is very ironic

         most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke
         into
         boisterous play. and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books
         and
         reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other
         boys soon followed his example, selecting the <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">smoothest and roundest<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>Why do they pick the smoothest and roundest stones if the stones are
                  being used to kill someone? Why would they want something so visually pleasing to
                  commit
                  such a terrible act?</span></span></span> stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie
         Delacroix-- <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;E1&#39;)">the villagers pronounced this name
               "Dellacroy"<span class="popuptext" id="E1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>The name "Delacroix" comes from the french words "de la Croix" or in
                  english; "of the Cross". In french, this name is pronounced delah-kwah instead of
                  dellacroy, like the villagers pronounce it.</span></span></span>--eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the
         square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside,
         talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the dust or clung
         to
         the hands of their older brothers or sisters. </p>

      <p>Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and
         rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the
         corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women,
         wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They
         <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;REP1&#39;)">greeted<span class="popuptext" id="REP1"><br><b>Replace: </b>avoided looking at</span></span></span> one another and exchanged <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;REP2&#39;)">bits of gossip<span class="popuptext" id="REP2"><br><b>Replace: </b>nervous glances</span></span></span> as they went to join their husbands.
         Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the
         children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked
         under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His
         father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father
         and his oldest brother. </p>

      <p>The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween
         program--by Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He
         was a
         round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him.
         because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square,
         carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers,
         and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves,
         followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center
         of the
         square and <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RES1&#39;)">Mr. Summers set the black box down on
               it.<span class="popuptext" id="RES1"><br><b>Restory: </b>(From Mr. Summers perspective) I hate this day. I organize so many
                  events for this town and they make everyone so happy, but I know they could never
                  dissociate my name from this event. Each year there is a part of me that hopes my
                  slip
                  of paper will have a dark black circle on it. If it did, I would never have to witness
                  another lottery again.</span></span></span> The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves
         and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?"
         there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter. came
         forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers
         inside it.</p>

      <p>The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box
         now
         resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest
         man in
         town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box,
         but <span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CR1&#39;)">no one liked to upset even as much tradition as
               was represented by the black box.<span class="popuptext" id="CR1"><br><b>Close Read: </b>Later in the story Old Man Warner talks about how crazy it is that
                  people are getting rid of the lottery tradition. Obviously not everyone is a fan of
                  tradition, especially ones like these, but others are afraid of change.</span></span></span> There was a story that the present box
         had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been
         constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year,
         after
         the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject
         was allowed to fade off without anything's being done. The black box grew shabbier
         each
         year: by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side
         to
         show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.</p>
