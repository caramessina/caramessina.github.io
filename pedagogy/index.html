            <p>Her pedagogy and overall values center around transparency, documenting and valuing process, subverting normalized cultural and social narratives, vulnerability, collaboration, justice, and cross-disciplinary conversations. In her classroom and her research, she incorporates Digital Humanities (especially #transformDH conversations), Writing Studies, Fan and Media Studies, RGS, Digital (critical) Pedagogy, and Science and Technology Studies practices and methodologies. She has worked with R to analyze large corpora that she retrieved from Archive of Our Own and is currently learning Python to continue doing computational text analysis. Part of her hope for doing computational text analysis is to celebrate the labors of love performed in fan communities; these labors of love often revolve around and are performed by queer communities, women (all types of women), people of color, and neurally diverse people. One of the questions she is curious about is how has and will the fandom change as they are being recognized and celebrated by creators and mainstream culture?</p>
            <p>She is currently working on an XML schema that is inspired by the process fan fiction
                writers take while they are reading, watching, and listening to the canonical texts
                that they love. The schema, called the remiXML, centers around transformative
                interventions in original texts and is currently in its first public version that
                Cara used in her First Year Writing Fall 2017 semester class. <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML/tree/master/version2">The schema for version
                2</a> is designed to focus much more on transformative practices when reading original
                texts and was used during the Spring 2018 semester. Using teacher-research
                practices, she will research and better improve the use of the remiXML schema in the
                classroom for helping to develop and transform reading practices.</p>
