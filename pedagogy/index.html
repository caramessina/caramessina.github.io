            <h1>Critical Digital Pedagogy</h1>
            <p>My pedagogy and overall values center around transparency, documenting and
                valuing process, subverting normalized cultural and social narratives,
                vulnerability, collaboration, justice, and cross-disciplinary conversations. In my
                classrooms and research, I merge digital humanities and #transformDH,
                writing studies, digital writing studies methodologies, fan and media studies, rhetorical genre studies, and critical
                digital pedagogy.</p>
            <h2>Digital Pedagogy Project: remiXML</h2>
            <p>Inspired by digital pedagogy and the notion of coding as writing, the First Year
                classrooms I create center around utilizing a self-designed XML schema inspired by
                how fanfiction writers approach the texts they love. The schema is currently in its
                second version, heavily revised from the first version. The RelaxNG schemas and the
                XSLT stylesheets are available on my <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML">GitHub page</a>.</p>
            
            <p>The first version, which I used in my Fall 2017 semester First Year Writing course,
                had more generalized elements that did not encourage specific categories. There was
                also an element, called feedback, which encouraged peer revision techniques. Student
                writers in the classroom used the remiXML version 1 to mark up published texts by
                authors like Roxane Gay, Claudia Rankine, and Shirley Jackson. They also used the
                remiXML to mark up each others’ essays as an attempt to bridge the gap between
                “professional” writer and themselves. The version was successful in encouraging peer
                review, but most student writers used the and tag on each others’ work. The focus
                became more on “review” than “engagement.” To find more documentation about remiXML
                version 1.0, <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML/tree/master/version1">please visit the version1 folder on my GitHub page</a>.
                
            </p>
            
            <p>Based off this experience, remiXML version 2.0 focused more on creative approaches to
                reading and attempting to categorize types of reading more explicitly. For example,
                the element became and several attributes values were added. Several elements were
                in the original version (restory was called transform, however); with the extra
                attributes, though, I have hoped to inspire student writers to use these attributes
                in more specific and pointed ways (the new attributes were borrowed from Ebony
                Elizabeth Thomas and Amy Stornaiuolo's article "Restorying the Self"). For example, the element has an attribute value called “bending,” which asks the student user to bend the identity of a particular character. This is inspired by racebending, queerbending, genderbending, and other types of identity bending practices that fanfiction writers take on in their work. </p>
            
    <p>  
      The feedback element was also erased in the second version, as I decided to assign the remiXML
      for student writers to mark up professional authors’ texts instead of both professional
      authors’ and their peers’ work. I began referring to “peer review” as “peer engagement,” as
      well, to encourage a focus on reading as active and excited readers, rather than reading to
      review. For more documentation about remiXML version 2.0, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML/tree/master/version2">version2 folder on my GitHub page</a>.</p>
      
            <h2>Women Writers Vector Toolkit</h2>
            <p>For the Women Writers Vector Toolkit, I designed three different assignments that can
            be implemented in classroom settings. The first is a basic introduction to word vector
            analysis and the Word Vector Interface. The second looks specifically at the clustering
            function as a method for discovery. The final assignment asks learners to compare
            literary centuries based on the corpora. To read these assignments and use them in your
            course, visit the <a href="https://wwp-test.northeastern.edu/wwo/lab/wwvt/teaching-exploration/assignments/index.html">Women Writers Vector Toolkit assignments page</a>.</p>
