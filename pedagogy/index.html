            <h1>Critical Digital Pedagogy</h1>
            <p>My pedagogy and overall values center around transparency, documenting and
                valuing process, subverting normalized cultural and social narratives,
                vulnerability, collaboration, justice, and cross-disciplinary conversations. In my
                classrooms and research, I merge digital humanities and #transformDH initiatives, digital writing studies methodologies, fan and media studies, rhetorical genre studies, and critical digital pedagogy.</p>

            <h2>Digital Pedagogy Project: remiXML</h2>
            <p>Inspired by digital pedagogy and the notion of coding as writing, the First Year
                classrooms I create center around utilizing a self-designed XML schema inspired by
                how fanfiction writers approach the texts they love. The schema is currently in its
                second version, heavily revised from the first version. The RelaxNG schemas and the
                XSLT stylesheets are available on my <a href="https://github.com/caramessina/remiXML">GitHub page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Women Writers Vector Toolkit</h2>
            <p>For the Women Writers Vector Toolkit, I designed three different assignments that can
            be implemented in classroom settings. The first is a basic introduction to word vector
            analysis and the Word Vector Interface. The second looks specifically at the clustering
            function as a method for discovery. The final assignment asks learners to compare
            literary centuries based on the corpora. To read these assignments and use them in your
            course, visit the <a href="https://wwp-test.northeastern.edu/wwo/lab/wwvt/teaching-exploration/assignments/index.html">Women Writers Vector Toolkit assignments page</a>.</p>
