         <h1>The Lottery</h1>
         <h2>By Shirley Jackson</h2>
      </div>


      <p>The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer,
         and the
         feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly
         for a while before they broke into boisterous play. and their talk was still of the
         classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. <span style="color:purple"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;Q1&#39;)">Bobby Martin had already stuffed his
               pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the
               smoothest and roundest stones;<span class="popuptext" id="Q1"><br><b>Question: </b>Why were stones being collected, and why were the smoothest and roundest stones favored?</span></span></span> Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix-- the
         villagers pronounced this name "Dellacroy"--eventually made a great pile of stones
         in
         one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls
         stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at rolled in the
         dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters. </p>

      <p>Soon the men began to gather. surveying their own children, speaking of planting and
         rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the
         corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. <span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RES2&#39;)">The women,
               wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted
               one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands.<span class="popuptext" id="RES2"><br><b>Restory: </b>The women, wearing leather jackets, skinny jeans, and heels arrived to the square
                  greeting each other, eventually meeting up with their husbands.</span></span></span> Soon the
         women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children
         came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under
         his
         mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of <span style="color:orange"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RP1&#39;)">stones<span class="popuptext" id="RP1"><br><b>Replace: </b>weapons</span></span></span>. His father spoke
         up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest
         brother. </p>

      <p>The lottery was conducted--as were the square dances, the teen club, the Halloween
         program--by Mr. Summers. who had time and energy to devote to civic activities.<span style="color:green"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;RES1&#39;)"> He was a
               round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him.
               because he had no children and his wife was a scold.<span class="popuptext" id="RES1"><br><b>Restory: </b>He had a defined jaw line and owned multiple companies, people looked up to him because
                  of his massive success and beautiful wife.</span></span></span> When he arrived in the square,
         carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers,
         and he waved and called. "Little late today, folks." The postmaster, Mr. Graves,
         followed him, carrying a three- legged stool, and the stool was put in the center
         of the
         square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance,
         leaving a space between themselves and the stool. and when Mr. Summers said, "Some
         of
         you fellows want to give me a hand?" there was a hesitation before two men. Mr. Martin
         and his oldest son, Baxter. came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while
         Mr.
         Summers stirred up the papers inside it.</p>

      <p><span style="color:blue"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;CL1&#39;)"> The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black
               box now
               resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest
               man in
               town, was born.<span class="popuptext" id="CL1"><br><b>Close Read: </b>The author clearly uses this sentence to put in perspective just how old this tradition
                  really is, the original content is not even used anymore.</span></span></span> Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box,
         but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box.
         There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that
         had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down
         to
         make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again
         about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's
         being done. The black box grew shabbier each year: <span style="color:pink"><span class="popup" onclick="myFunction(this, &#39;DS1&#39;)">by now it was no longer completely
               black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in
               some
               places faded or stained.<span class="popuptext" id="DS1"><br><b>Expansion: </b>Similar to the black box, the villagers who fell victim to the box were also left
                  splintered and faded.</span></span></span></p>
