                <h2>Fan Studies Research Goals and Interests</h2>
                <p>For my work in fan studies, I am interested in a) ethical research
                    methodologies when
                    working with fans and fan materials (and more generally digital
                    writing research); b) prioritizing role of queer communities,
                    marginalized genders, people of color, and neurally diverse writers and
                    characters in these communities; c) incorporating computational methods to
                    analyze larger corpora of fan texts; d) using Rhetorical Genre Studies to
                    analyze fan uptakes, genres and the embedded ideologies; and d) navigating my positionality as both
                    an active fan and academic. </p>
                <p><b>Digital Writing Research and Positionality</b></p>
                <p>By using digital writing research as a
                    methdological framework, I want to tringulate multiple sources of data,
                    including conversations with other fans, my own experiences, and fan materials
                    to describe genres and ideologies in online fan communities as well as
                    the impact of these literacy practices impact fans relationships with writing
                    and reading.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Computational Methods: Preliminary Findings</b></p>
                </p>With the permission of the Organization for
                    Transformative Works, I used <a href="https://github.com/radiolarian/AO3Scraper">Jingyi Li and Sarah Sterman's</a> Python code to
                    scrape over 7,000 <i>The Legend of Korra</i> fan fiction texts and their
                    metadata from <em>Archive of our Own</em>. I am using Python to conduct
                computational text analyses on this corpus. Part of my hope for doing computational text
                    analysis is to celebrate the labors of love performed in fan communities; these
                    labors of love often revolve around and are performed by marginalized people,
                    particular women, people from the queer community, and people of color. I also
                    want to think about the relationship between the original text (<em>The Legend of
                    Korra</em>) and fan genres/uptake. </p>
                <p>Using this corpus, I have created three different topic models: <ul><li>all the
                    English fanfictions from the corpus <a href="models/ga_ff_topic_model.html">(model now
                        available)</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>the English fanfictions rated "mature" (model soon to be available)</li>  <li>the English fanfictions rated "general
                        audience" (model soon to be available)</li></ul> </p>
                <p>I chose these particular models because of the average word counts
                    for each. The average word count for "General Audience" fan fictions is 2,000, while
                    the average word count for "Mature" fan fictions is 20,000. Based on my
                    participation in writing and reading fan fictions for 15 years, I speculates
                    this difference is because "Mature" fan fictions typically build tension between characters to
                    lead to moments of intimacy, while "General Audience" fan fictions are often
                    one-shots, or one chapter that explores a particular moment/idea from the
                    canonical text. Creating these topic models provides a more general understanding, pointing out
                    trends across the corpus. For example, several topics focus around the body,
                    touch, intimacy, and physicality. The concrete descriptions of intimacy suggest a larger genre convention in fanfiction.</p>
                <p>As my work continues, I plan to conduct interviews with fanfiction writers and,
                    based on these interviews, I will continue doing computational methods to get a
                    better understanding of the individual fan's experience as compared with larger
                    patterns in a particular corpus that resonates with that fan's experience. For
                    example, if I speak with someone who writes <em>Supernatural</em> fanfic, I may
                    conduct computational text analysis on a <em>Supernatural</em> fanfic corpus to
                    see larger patterns across the board and compare those with that fan's
                    experience. </p>
