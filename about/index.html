                <li>Doctoral candidate at Northeastern University's English Department</li>

                <p><strong>Research:</strong> My overall
                    research and pedagogy concerns the representation and celebration of
                    critical and counternormative narratives. My dissertation will create a Critical Fan Toolkit
                    that fans can use to become more critical in their practices and teachers can
                    use to incorporate critical fan pedagogies.

                        empower and engage students so they think critically about how narratives
                        may reinforce or challenge racism, sexism, homophobia,
                        transphobia, and ableism. </p>
