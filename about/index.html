                <strong>Cara Marta Messina [she/her]</strong>
                <ul>
                <li>Doctoral candidate at Northeastern University's English Department</li>
                <li>Writing Studies + New Media</li>
                <li>Fan studies, rhetorical genre studies, critical digital
                    pedagogy, cultural studies, and anti-racist and anti-misogyny advocate.</li></ul>
                <p>My overall
                    research and pedagogy concerns the representation and celebration of
                    counternormative narratives. I am currently working on my dissertation in which
                    I plan to explore why fanfiction (and other fan media) is meaningful to its
                    creators and readers. One of my goals is to focus on each writers' perspective
                    and use that perspective to then conduct quantitative analyses using methods
                    like topic modeling, word vectors, and more. For some of the preliminary
                    practices of these methods, check out my <a
                        href="../fan-studies/index.html">topic model visualizations</a> for over
                    7,000 <em>The Legend of Korra</em> fanfictions I collected from <em>Archive of
                        our Own.</em></p>
                <p>This year, I am the Coordinator for the <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/nulab/">NULab for Texts,
                    Maps, and Networks</a>. As the Coordinator, I help co-lead the Digital Teaching Initiative, which is in its pilot stages
                    working with
                    Humanities and Social Science faculty who are interested in including digital
                    tools and methods in their classroom.</p>
                    
                    <p>As for some of the organizational work I do at Northeastern, I am currently
                        the President of the English
                    Graduate Student Association President. This year, we are organizing the annual
                    EGSA conference; the theme we chose is "Centering the Margins" to highlight the
                    work of people who are historically, poltiically, and socially marginalized. I am also helping to co-lead the <a href="https://digitalfeministcommons.northeastern.edu/">Feminist Coding Collective
                (formerly the Digital Feminist Commons)</a>, which prioritizes creating an inclusive feminist
                    space for people to learn and practice coding.</p>
       
                    <p>In the past, I have worked in numerous writing centers, including at Columbia
                        University's
                        School of Social Work and SUNY Empire. My heart is always with writing
                        center work, so I still invest publishing and conference time and labor into
                        the discipline. My first year at Northeastern, I held the position of Director of Research
                        at the Writing Center at Northeastern where I and members of NuRig – the writing center research inquiry
                        group – collected data about how clients and consultants articulate their
                        understanding of the work done in writing centers. 
                        <p>I have taught First Year
                        Writing and Advanced Writing in the Disciplines at St. John's University and
                        Northeastern University. In my FYW courses, which you can read more about
                         <a href="../pedagogy/index.html">here,</a> I integrate fan practices to
                            empower and engage students so they think critically about how narratives may reinforce or subvert racism, sexism, homophobia,
                            transphobia, and ableism. </p>
                  
                  <p>I have also worked closely on two projects at Northeastern:<p>
                      <ul><li>I was a Research Associate for <a href="https://dsg.neu.edu/research/design-for-diversity/">Design for
                    Diversity</a>, an IMLS-grant funded national forum project, at Northeastern’s
                    Digital Scholarship Group. I helped organize the Opening Forum event in October
                    2017 <a
                        href="https://dsg.neu.edu/design-for-diversity-opening-forum-a-reflection/">(read
                        my reflection of the event here).</a> I also helped to build and design the
                          early stages of the  <a href="https://des4div.library.northeastern.edu/">Design for Diversity Teaching
                              and Learning Toolkit,</a> which centers around equitable and just practices in
                information systems. </li>
                      <li>I also worked on the Pedagogy and Infrastructure Teams for the. <a href="https://wwp-test.northeastern.edu/wwo/lab/wwvt/">Women
                          Writers Vector Toolkit.</a> I wrote several assignments, helped build the
                          website, wrote and narrated scripts to help explain the Word Vector
                          Interface, and more.</li></ul>
