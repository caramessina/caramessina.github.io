                <ul>
                <li>Doctoral candidate at Northeastern University's English Department</li>

                <p><strong>Research:</strong> My overall
                    research and pedagogy concerns the representation and celebration of
                    counternormative narratives. My dissertation will create a Critical Fan Toolkit
                    that fans can use to become more critical in their practices and teachers can
                    use to incorporate critical fan pedagogies.
                    <p><strong>Current Position: </strong>I am the Assistant Director of the <a

                        <a href="../pedagogy/index.html">here,</a> I integrate fan practices to
                        empower and engage students so they think critically about how narratives may reinforce or subvert racism, sexism, homophobia,
                        transphobia, and ableism. </p>
