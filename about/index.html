                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>My research meets at the intersection of feminism, fan studies, digital rhetoric, game studies, rhetorical genre studies, and critical digital pedagogy. My current manuscript, <cite>Writing Critical Fandoms: Tracing Representations of Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Fanfiction</cite> explores critical fan uptakes in fanfiction, or specifically how fans challenge heternormativity, racism, and ableism in their fanfiction composing practices. This manuscript is a revision and extension of my dissertation, <a href="http://criticalfantoolkit.org/">The Critical Fan Toolkit</a>, which received honorary mention for the Computers and Composition Distinguished Dissertation Award in 2021.

                    <h2>Pedagogy:</h2>
                <p>I received the 2019 <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/awards/gradadjunctnom.html">Kairos Graduate Student Teaching
                        Award</a>. At Jacksonville State University, I teach courses such as Technical Writing, Speech, Writing for the Web, Writing for Podcasts, and Introduction to Game Studies. At Northeastern University, I taught <a href="../pedagogy/syllabus/writing-for-social-media-syllabus.pdf">online Writing for Social Media course</a>. I have also taught First Year
                        Writing and Advanced Writing in the Disciplines at St. John's University and
                        Northeastern University. In my FYW courses, which you can read more about
                        <a href="../pedagogy/index.html">here,</a> I integrate fan practices to
                        empower and engage students so they think critically about how narratives
                        may reinforce or challenge racism, sexism, homophobia,
                        transphobia, and ableism. </p>
                    <h2>Service</h2>
                <p>In the field, I am on the Kairos editorial board and serve on several different committees for the Conference of College of Composition and Communication: The Writing and Rhetoric of Code special interest group and the Assessing Whiteness for Understanding, Equity, and Change committee. At Jacksonville State University, I currently serve on several committees, including the Speech committee, the English Department Reading Series, and the College of Arts and Humanities Strategic Plan Committee.</p>
