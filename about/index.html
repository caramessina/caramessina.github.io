                <h2><strong>Research</strong></h2> 
                <p>My research meets at the intersection of fan studies, digital rhetoric, rhetorical genre studies, and critical digital pedagogy. My main research question for my dissertation is: How and why do fans resist harmful cultural ideologies in their uptakes of fan genres? This toolkit incorporates interactive data, interviews with fans, teaching materials, and other resources for fans and instructors alike. Critical fan practices are the ways in which fans resist harmful and exclusive cultural ideologies in their uptakes; specifically, critical fandom practices are the thoughtful integrations the politics of power, gender, sexuality, disability, and race in their fans’ participations in fan genres in order to combat homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and ableism. In my article published in <cite>The Journal of Writing Analytics</cite>, I define critical uptakes and other forms of fan uptakes, demonstrating how computational methods like word embedding models and Natural Language Processing can be used to trace uptakes and generic conventions.</p>
                    <p>I also do interdisciplinary research incorporating computational and qualitative methods, thinking through how digital tools can be used to persuade and reach our audiences. Currently, I am co-editing a special issue of <cite>Digital Humanities Quarterly</cite> with Alanna Prince and Dr. Izetta Autumn Mobley on Black Digital Humanities. I receieved the <cite>Conference on College Composition and Communication</cite> Research Initiative grant with Mya Poe and Cherice Jones to trace multilingual writers' practices in order to challenge limiting North American narratives around multilingual and/or international writers. My overall resaerch goal is to collaborate with scholars and students across the disciplines to strengthen methods, build digital projects, and advocate for justice.</p>
                
                    <h2><strong>Pedagogy:</strong></h2> 
                <p>I received the 2019 <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/awards/gradadjunctnom.html">Kairos Graduate Student Teaching
                        Award</a>. I am teaching an <a href="../pedagogy/syllabus/writing-for-social-media-syllabus.pdf">online Writing for Social Media course</a>; the goal of the course is to demonstrate the interdependent relationship between online writing practices and real world systems of power; specifically, we look at online community participation, identity formation and connection through writing practices, the constraints and affordances across platforms, and ethical issues around data surveillance, enviornmental impact, and activism. Read my syllabus in the pedagogy section. I have also taught First Year
                        Writing and Advanced Writing in the Disciplines at St. John's University and
                        Northeastern University. In my FYW courses, which you can read more about
                        <a href="../pedagogy/index.html">here,</a> I integrate fan practices to
                        empower and engage students so they think critically about how narratives
                        may reinforce or challenge racism, sexism, homophobia,
                        transphobia, and ableism. </p>
                    <h2><strong>Service:</strong></h2>
                <p>I am the current founder and chair of the
                        Northeastern English Department's Graduate Student Welfare Group, where we
                        create newsletter to celebrate graduate students and provide resources; lead
                        or organize workshops around various topics such as microagressions and
                        Title IX/campus resources around sexual harassment; and collaboratively write
                        statements to support particular groups of students or organizations. I also
                        contributed to the <a
