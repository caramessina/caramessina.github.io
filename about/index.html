                <p><strong>Research:</strong> My overall
                    research and pedagogy concerns the representation and celebration of
                    critical and counternormative narratives, especially in fan communities and genres. My dissertation, the <a href="http://criticalfantoolkit.org">Critical Fan Toolkit</a>, is a teaching and learning toolkit for fans, scholars, and instructors alike. The purpose of the tookit is twofold: 1) to examine and define critical fan uptakes across fanfiction genres, and 2) to provide research method and data literacy resources for learners across positions to trace genre conventions, uptakes, and community literacy practices. The toolkit uses critical fandoms and rhetorical genre studies as a theoretical framework, and incorporates qualiative and quantiative methods from digital rhetoric, digital humanities, and writing analytics.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pedagogy:</strong> I received the 2019 <a href="http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/awards/gradadjunctnom.html">Kairos Graduate Student Teaching
                        Award</a>. I am teaching an <a href="../pedagogy/syllabus/writing-for-social-media-syllabus.pdf">online Writing for Social Media course</a>; the goal of the course is to demonstrate the interdependent relationship between online writing practices and real world systems of power; specifically, we look at online community participation, identity formation and connection through writing practices, the constraints and affordances across platforms, and ethical issues around data surveillance, enviornmental impact, and activism. Read my syllabus in the pedagogy section. I have also taught First Year
                        Writing and Advanced Writing in the Disciplines at St. John's University and
                        Northeastern University. In my FYW courses, which you can read more about
                        <a href="../pedagogy/index.html">here,</a> I integrate fan practices to
                        empower and engage students so they think critically about how narratives
                        may reinforce or challenge racism, sexism, homophobia,
                        transphobia, and ableism. </p>

                        or organize workshops around various topics such as microagressions and
                        Title IX/campus resources around sexual harassment; and collaboratively write
