                <h1>Cara Marta Messina</h1>
                <p>Cara Marta Messina [she/her] is a fourth year doctoral candidate focusing on
                    Writing and Rhetoric in Northeastern University’s English Department. Her focus
                    is Writing Studies and Digital Humanities, particularly fan genres and
                    publics. Her
                    research interests include–but are not limited to–fan studies, critical digital
                    pedagogy, digital and coding rhetorics, #transformDH, and representations of counternormative narratives.</p>
                    <p>She is currently working on her digital dissertation titled "The Critical Fan
                        Toolkit: Fanfiction Genres, Ideologies, and Pedagogies." This toolkit will
                        incorporate interactive data, interviews with fans, teaching materials, and other
                        resources for fans and instructors alike. Critical fan practices are the
                        ways in which fans resist harmful and exclusive cultural ideologies in their
                        uptakes; specifically, critical fandom practices are the thoughtful
                        integrations the politics of power, gender, sexuality, disability, and race
                        in their fans’ participations in fan genres in order to combat homophobia,
                        transphobia, sexism, racism, and ableism (<a

                        2016</a>). </p>

                <p>Outside of her work, Cara watches a bit too much <em>Sailor Moon</em> and brings
                    her pup, Efi, everywhere. Her hobbies revolve around reading, gaming, falling
                    into coding holes,
                    boxing, and imagining that she will someday make her own cosplays. She loves her
                friends dearly and believes professional and academic settings should
                celebrate friendships and kinships.</p>
