                <h1>Cara Marta Messina</h1>
                <p>Cara Marta Messina [she/her] is a third year doctoral candidate focusing on
                    Writing and Rhetoric in Northeastern University’s English Department. Her focus
                    is Writing Studies and New Media, particularly fan genres and
                    publics. Her
                    research interests include–but are not limited to–fan studies, critical digital
                    pedagogy,
                    intersectional feminism, #transformDH, and representations of counternormative narratives.</p>
                    <p>She is currently working on her dissertation, which explores how and why fanfiction (and other fan media) creators do what they do. Some of her larger
                    questions are: why do people write fanfiction? What are fanfiction genres? What
                    are the thoughts that go into the creation of these genres? How do fan practices
                    represent and push against uptake, or the appropriate responses to particular
                    genres? </p>
                
                <p>Outside of her work, Cara watches a bit too much <em>Sailor Moon</em> and brings
                    her pup, Efi, everywhere. Her hobbies revolve around reading, gaming, falling
                    into coding holes,
                    boxing, and imagining that she will someday make her own cosplays. She loves her
                friends dearly and believes professional and academic settings should
                celebrate friendships and kinships.</p>
