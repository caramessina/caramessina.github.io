                <p>Cara Marta Messina [she/her/hers] is an Assistant Professor of English Marist College. I receieved my Ph.D. in English, focusing on
                    Writing and Rhetoric, from Northeastern University in 2021. My work research is invested in digital rhetoric, fan studies, game studies, social justice, coding rhetorics, and digital humanities.</p>

                    <p>Outside of my work, I watch a bit too much anime and bring
                my pup, Efi, everywhere. My hobbies are reading, gaming, falling
                into coding holes,
              crocheting, and imagining that I will someday make my own cosplays. I believe professional and academic settings should
                cherish and support friendships and kinships.</p>

My dissertation, the Critical Fan Toolkit, is a teaching and learning digital resource for fans, scholars, and instructors alike. This toolkit:  1) Defines and traces critical fan uptakes using computational and qualitative methods. 2) Demonstrates how fans resist or reinforce the ideologies in the texts they love. 3)Provides methods to trace genre conventions and uptakes. 4)Shares teaching material for teaching critical fan pedagogies.'">

The header reads 'Critical Digital Pedagogy' and the rest reads,' I incorporate critical digital pedagogy in every facet of my teaching and mentorship. Critical digital pedagogy applies critical perspectives to digital environments and data by having learners engage with the political, social, and cultural implications at every level of the technological stack, from the hardware created to the documents we compose on. I received the 2019 Kairos Teaching Award for my commitment to critical digital pedagogy across the curriculum. I have taught: 1) Writing for Social Media -- syllabus available, 2) First Year Writing, 3) Advanced Writing in the Disciplines. My dream courses to teach include: 1) Social Media Composing, 2) Data and Coding Rhetorics, 3) Critical Fan Research Methods, 4) Digital Storytelling.'">
